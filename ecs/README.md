## Deploy the Alert Logic Agent Container for AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

## Before You Begin
- To deploy the Alert Logic Agent Container for Amazon ECS, you need your unique registration key unless the deployment is set up for automatic provisioning.
- These instructions are for ECS tasks with EC2 launch type. To deploy the Alert Logic Agent Container for ECS tasks with Fargate launch type, see [Fargate README](../fargate/README.md) instead.

**To find your unique registration key (Cloud Defender platform):**
1. In the Alert Logic console, click the Support Information icon.
2. Click "Details."
3. Copy your unique registration key.

In addition, be sure you install the AWS command line interface (CLI), and ensure you point it to, and configure it for, the appropriate AWS account. For more information about the AWS CLI, see https://aws.amazon.com/cli/.

## Deploy the Alert Logic Agent Container Task Definition
To deploy the Agent Container for Amazon ECS, you must download the task definition file from this repository, and then edit the file to include your Alert Logic unique registration key.

**To deploy and edit the task definition file:**
1. Download the al-agent-ecs.json task definition file from this repository.

2. In the task definition file, update the ```value``` variable with your unique registration key. Note that AWS deployments with valid credentials do not require registration keys, as provisioning is performed based on cloud metadata gathered by the agent and the Alert Logic back end. When using a supported cloud deployment, the `KEY` environment variable should be undefined.
   ```
   "environment": [
     {
       "name": "KEY",
       "value": "your_registration_key_here"
     }
   ]
   ```
3. In the Linux command line, type the following command to register your task definition:
   ```
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://path//to/task-definition/al-agent-ecs.json
   ```

## Modify your IAM Policy
Log into the AWS console to ensure the IAM role you use for Amazon ECS has the permissions required by the Agent Container. To do so, access the IAM policy document to verify it contains the permissions specified below.

**To view or modify an IAM policy:**

1. In the AWS Console, click **IAM,** located under **Security, Identity &Â Compliance**.
2. From the IAM Management Console, click **Policies**.
3. Select the policy attached to the IAM role you use for Amazon ECS, and then click **Edit Policy**.
3. Click **JSON**.
4. Review the policy document for the following permissions. Copy and paste any of the following permissions the policy document lacks into the JSON window:
   ```
         {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
                 "ecs:RegisterContainerInstance",
                 "ecs:DeregisterContainerInstance",
                 "ecs:DiscoverPollEndpoint",
                 "ecs:Submit*",
                 "ecs:Poll",
                 "ecs:StartTask",
                 "ecs:StartTelemetrySession"
             ],
             "Resource": [
                 "*"
             ]
         }
	```
5. Click **Review policy**.
6. On the Review Policy page, click **Save changes**.

## Enable Automatic Startup of the Alert Logic Agent Container
### Amazon ECS Daemon Scheduling:  Automatically Run the al-agent-container on Each Amazon ECS Instance
Effective June 12th, 2018, Amazon ECS supports daemon scheduling that allows you to automatically run a daemon task on every selected node in your ECS cluster. For more information, see the following AWS documentation. 

- [Amazon ECS Adds Daemon Scheduling](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/amazon-ecs-adds-daemon-scheduling/)
- [Amazon ECS Documentation for Service Scheduler Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html#service_scheduler)

### Legacy Amazon ECS Scheduling: Create a Startup Script for Your Amazon ECS Instances
You can manually create a startup script to ensure the agent starts when the host starts.

**To create the startup script:**

1. Copy the following command:
   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   mset -o pipefail

   cluster="MY_CLUSTER" # Enter your cluster name here

   task_def="al-agent-task"
   touch /etc/ecs/ecs.config || {
       echo "Error: it seems like we are not running on an ECS-optimized instance" >&2
       exit 2
   }
   set -ex
   echo ECS_CLUSTER=$cluster >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
   start ecs
   yum install -y aws-cli jq
   instance_arn=$( curl -f http://localhost:51678/v1/metadata | jq -re .ContainerInstanceArn | awk -F/ '{print $NF}')
   az=$(curl -f http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
   region=${az:0:${#az} - 1}
   echo "cluster=$cluster az=$az region=$region aws ecs start-task --cluster \
   $cluster --task-definition $task_def --container-instances $instance_arn --region $region" >> /etc/rc.local
   ```
2. Paste the command into the Linux command line.

### Legacy Amazon ECS Scheduling: Use AWS CloudFormation to Add Startup to Amazon ECS Cluster Instances
You can create an AWS CloudFormation template, or you can edit an existing template, that starts the Agent Container when the host starts. For more information about creating and updating AWS Cloudformation templates, see [Working with AWS CloudFormation Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-guide.html).

To create or edit an AWS CloudFormation template that starts the Agent Container upon host startup, copy and paste the following into the template:

   ```
   "UserData": {
      "Fn::Base64": {
        "Fn::Join": [
          "",
          [
            "#!/bin/bash -xe\n",
            "echo ECS_CLUSTER=",
            {
              "Ref": "YourECSClusterName"
            },
            " >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config\n",
            "start ecs || true\n",
            "sleep 30\n",
            "instance_arn=$(curl -s http://localhost:51678/v1/metadata | jq -r '. | .ContainerInstanceArn' | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' )\n",
            "az=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)\n",
            "cluster=\"", { "Ref": "YourECSClusterName" }, "\"\n",
            "region=${az:0:${#az} - 1}\n",
            "task_def=\"al-agent-task\"\n",
            "echo \"\n",
            "aws ecs start-task --cluster $cluster --task-definition $task_def --container-instances $instance_arn --region $region >> /etc/rc.local\n"
          ]
        ]
      }
   }
   ```
